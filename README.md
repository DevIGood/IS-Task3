#Develop an RSA algorithm encryption/decryption system. You can choose which type of system to build.

##Features to implement:

3 points - input of initial data: two primary numbers p and q, initial plaintext x.✅

6 points - finding the parameters required for encryption/decryption algorithms. Public key finding, Euclidean algorithm implementation, Euclidean advanced algorithm implementation.✅

2 points - encryption of the plaintext x.✅

2 points - save encrypted plaintext x and public key (n,e) in the file system or database.✅

2 points - read encrypted plaintext x from the file system or database.✅
 
5 points - decrypt encrypted plaintext x. The decryption method requires an additional method that has n to find the two prime numbers. When have the primes numbers system can find the value of Φ[n]. Having Φ[n] and e, can compute the private key. ✅
